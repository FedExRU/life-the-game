# ReactJS Conway's Game of Life

### About

The Game of Life is a cellular automaton devised by the british mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970. It was popularised by Martin Gardner in his October 1970 column of "Mathematical Games" in the "Scientific American" magazine. The article garnered more response than any other of his previous articles in the magazine, including Gardners famous article on Hexaflexagons.

### Rules of the game

- A live cell dies if it has fewer than two live neighbors.
- A live cell with two or three live neighbors lives on to the next generation;
- A live cell with more than three live neighbors dies;
- A dead cell will be brought back to live if it has exactly three live neighbors.
